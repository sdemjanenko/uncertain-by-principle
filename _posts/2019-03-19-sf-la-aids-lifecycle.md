title: "SF/LA AIDS LifeCycle"

June 2nd through 8th I will be riding from San Francisco to Los Angeles as a cyclist in the
AIDS LifeCycle ride. The route will be 545 miles. I am mostly doing this ride for the challenge
but I also think it is a great cause. If you are interested in donating to this great cause
please visit my [LifeCycle site](http://www.tofighthiv.org/goto/sdemjanenko).
