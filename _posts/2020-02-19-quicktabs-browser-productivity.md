title: "Quick Tabs: improving my browser productivity"
---

I am a big believer in the ROI of spending a little time every day optimizing my
work habits. Yesterday I installed the Chrome/Chromium extension
[Quick Tabs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quick-tabs/jnjfeinjfmenlddahdjdmgpbokiacbbb).

I usually have 50+ tabs open in my web browser. Finding a specific tab that I
want to switch takes longer than I want. This extension lets me fuzzy search for
the tab I want.

After installing the extension I had to set up the keyboard shortcut that opens
the extension's UI. This can be done at: [chrome://extensions/shortcuts](chrome://extensions/shortcuts).
I configured my browser to use Alt-A.

I really like that this extension is open source on
[Github](https://github.com/babyman/quick-tabs-chrome-extension).
