title: Welcome - First post

This is my first post.  With the new year about to roll around I have decided that it is time to partake in the coding community.
This blog will mainly be focused on Ruby and Javascript since I use both every day.

My goals of this blog are:
- Catalog and analyze various Javascript and Ruby libraries
- Learn from the feedback of others
- Improve my documentation skills
- Motivate me to create more side projects
- Have fun
